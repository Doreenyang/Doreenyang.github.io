She is developing Linked Data (ontologies, metadata, Semantic Web) approaches to manage scientific evidence. Schneider has worked as an actuarial analyst for a Fortune 500 insurance company, as the gift buyer for a small independent bookstore, and in academic science and web libraries.

## About My Project

In this project, I will make a web application about the research funding transparency, called “WhoFundedIt.” The overall goal of the web app is to visualize the funding report for each research in the list of scientific publications. First, I plan to do basic research and investigation about the Biblioshiny and understand how it works. After that, I’ll consider the similarity and difference between this app and the one I’ll make. Then, I’ll design my web app with detailed schedule and plan about design document. After I finish the planning, I’ll give a presentation to the lab and get any suggestions and comments from other people. I’ll need to revise some of my plan possibly to make it better after getting all the comments. Next, I plan to start to do my plans and write a documentation, which may take a longer time. After finishing that, I’ll test and get feedback to improve the web app. At the end of the research, I plan to write a report about the project and the future work that can help other people understand the project. Besides, I hope I can take my project to some conference to present it or maybe I can write a paper about it if I can get some really helpful results.
