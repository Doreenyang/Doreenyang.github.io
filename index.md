## About Me

Hello! My name is Deyuan Yang, and I go by Doreen. I'm a Junior at Washington University in St. Louis, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. Iâ€™m a software engineer coding quality digital experiences and an occasional designer for the web. Currently working on a web application development project. 

## About My Projects

### [Underground Dojo UI/UX Design (Cowork with Jason Ti)](https://www.figma.com/file/gJ6mnO3GYwyW0fthXk4xw2/Basic-View?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=ALqVdxcV4RUfKgIr-0): 

This project is a collaborative work between me and Chang Ti (my coworker from Design Agency), focusing on crafting the user interface and experience for a local game shop using Figma. Through iterative design processes and real-time collaboration, the goal is to create an engaging and intuitive design that reflects the theme and branding of the Underground Dojo game shop. By carefully considering the layout, navigation, visual elements, and interactive components, the aim is to deliver a seamless and immersive user experience tailored to the needs of the target audience, enhancing their enjoyment and ease of use while navigating the game shop's offerings.


### [The second version of the game shop UI/UX design](https://www.figma.com/file/5mzZ2JD6zuT1MPgJqcgtTS/Gameshop?type=design&node-id=138-1972&mode=design&t=8iJGatBI7RWrglut-0): 

This project is aimed at showcasing the preferences of the game shop owner and also an opportunity to practice my Figma design skills. By using existing templates and borrowing design elements, the project doesn't start from scratch, allowing for a quicker iteration process. Through careful consideration of the owner's preferences and leveraging Figma's features, such as collaborative design and interactive prototyping, the objective is to create a visually appealing and functional user interface that aligns with the shop's branding and enhances the overall user experience. This version serves as a valuable learning experience in both design principles and Figma proficiency while catering to the specific needs of the game shop owner.


### [Underground Dojo Website Development (Cowork with Jason Ti)](https://github.com/Jasonti20/UndergrounDojo): 

This project is a collaborative work with Chang Ti, focused on the development of the Underground Dojo game shop website following the completion of the UI/UX design phase. 
Continuing the work we designed for the website, we implemented the designed user interface into a fully functional website. Leveraging HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The project seeks to ensure seamless integration of design elements, responsive layout, and optimized performance. This development phase marks a crucial step in transforming the design concepts into a tangible and interactive online platform for the game shop, aligning closely with the project's overarching goals and objectives.


### [Underground Dojo Advertisement Generator](https://github.com/Doreenyang/AdvGenerator): 

This project includes various tools and technologies to automate the creation of advertisements for the game shop. Integrating the ChatGPT4 API, Streamlit, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects, the project allows users to input an image of a game character, which is then used to generate advertisements automatically using the GPT-4 API. These generated ads are further enhanced by converting them into videos, with the game character speaking the advertisement while mimicking body movements. Through this innovative approach, the project aims to streamline the advertisement creation process, offering an efficient solution for marketing campaigns. By combining the power of AI-generated content with visual effects, the project promises to deliver compelling and engaging advertisements tailored to the Underground Dojo game shop's needs.


### [A personal website design](https://www.figma.com/file/CeLcSuxcHLbSi74UEraKln/Portfolio?type=design&node-id=1601-2&mode=design&t=uxVZn0wRuTEIuPBa-0):

This is a design for my personal website, still in its initial stages of development. Created using Figma, the design offers a glimpse into the envisioned layout and aesthetics of the website. While incomplete, it provides a foundation upon which to build and refine the overall look and feel of the website. As a work in progress, the design serves as a starting point for further exploration and iteration, allowing for the incorporation of additional elements and features to enhance the user experience. 


### ["WhoFundedIt" Web Application Design and Development](https://github.com/infoqualitylab/WhoFundedIt-app): 


This project is focused on creating a web application that generates funder information for a list of scientific publications. Developed using R and Shiny as the primary language and framework, the project integrates data from the Crossref API to gather information about funding sources associated with scientific publications. Through a user-friendly interface, users can input a list of publications, and the application retrieves and visualizes funder data, offering insights into the funding landscape of the publications. The project combines data integration, web development, and data visualization techniques to provide researchers and stakeholders with valuable information about funding sources in the scientific domain.
