The topic of my project is "Continuous subjective cybersickness assessment"
Objectives: The current gold standard metric for cybersickness assessment is subjective reporting. The two most commonly used instruments are the Kennedy-Lane SSQ (administered after an immersive experience) and the FMS (fast motion sickeness) scale, administered at repeated discrete intervals during an immersive experience, such as every 2 minutes. We seek to learn patterns of data associated with impending cybersickness, to be able to predict cybersickness onset before it occurs. These efforts would be facilitated if we had access to continuous data about cybersickness outcomes along with continuous data about the visual stimulus (e.g. 3D optical flow, considering contrast and brightness) and the user’s head/eye behaviors (e.g. instantaneous 6DOF head pose, eye gaze, and gradients thereof) as well as various physiological measures.
